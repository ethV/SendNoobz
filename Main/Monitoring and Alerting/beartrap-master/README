BearTrap v0.2-beta

BearTrap is meant to be a portable network defense utility written entirely in
Ruby.  It opens "trigger" ports on the host that an attacker would connect to.
When the attacker connects and/or performs some interactions with the trigger
an alert is raised and the attacker's ip address is potentially blacklisted.

The idea came from listening to the PaulDotCom Security Podcast
(http://pauldotcom.com/security-weekly/) particularly episodes 203 and 204 as
the concept of honeyports is described.

Dependencies:

Ruby 1.9.x interpreter
	Installation varies from system to system.
getopt ruby gem
	Install with 'gem install getopt'

Installation:

No installation required.  Simply edit the configuration file, config.yml.  It
should be fairly well documented and/or self-explanatory.  If its not, check
out the support section below.

Usage:

ruby bear_trap.rb -c config.yml

Running as root is recommended, as most blacklisting tools (pfctl, iptables,
etc) must be ran as root.

Support:
