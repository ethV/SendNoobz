Joomla Toolkit
=================


In case we are given a Joomla site in our network, we should have some tools to defend it.

This looks like a good checklist: [https://docs.joomla.org/Security_Checklist/Joomla!_Setup](https://docs.joomla.org/Security_Checklist/Joomla!_Setup)



* [`jamss.php`](jamss.php)

    Added by John Hammond. Credited repo is here: [https://github.com/btoplak/Joomla-Anti-Malware-Scan-Script--JAMSS-](https://github.com/btoplak/Joomla-Anti-Malware-Scan-Script--JAMSS-). A PHP script that can just be uploaded and ran. View it with `/jamss.php?deepscan=1` for even better results.

* [`joomscan.zip`](joomscan.zip)

    Added by John Hammond. Credited repo is here: [https://github.com/rezasp/joomscan](https://github.com/rezasp/joomscan) This is a Perl script that will scan a given Joomla site. It looks to be very effective. 


--------------------


These tools should be the most helpful thing. If you need to look by hand, check out the Vulnerable Extensions List given here: [https://docs.joomla.org/Archived:Vulnerable_Extensions_List](https://docs.joomla.org/Archived:Vulnerable_Extensions_List)
